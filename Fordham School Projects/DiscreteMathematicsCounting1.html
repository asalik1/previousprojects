	<h1>Introduction</h1>


		<p>

			Although counting sounds like something that a


			child would learn in elementary school, it is something


			that is necessary to review and practice, even for college students.


			The basics of counting are focused on addition and multiplication. With enough practice and knowledge


			of the basics in counting, we will begin working with more complicated topics like


			combinations and permutations. These 4 topics can be implemented in many different ways in real life as you will see in the provided examples.

		</p>

<hr>

			<h1>Addition Rule</h1>


				<p> The addition rule is the number of outcomes for each choice added to together.


				For two choices: |O1+O2| = |O1| + |O2|, where O is the number of outcomes for a specific choice.


				If there were more choices we would add the number of outcomes for each extra choice we would make.


				A general idea about addition is that it is used when we see the word ''or.''


				</p>


				<p><strong>Example</strong>: In a deck of cards, how many cards are a 9 or a 6? </p>
<center>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eBRsKEj.png" height="225" width="425">
</center>


				<p class="tab"> Solution: There are four cards of 9 and four cards of 6 in a deck of cards. Since we are


				asked for the total number of 9 or a 6 in the deck, we add the amount of each together.


				4 + 4 = 8. There are 8 cards in the deck that are a 9 or 6. </p>


<hr>


			<h1>Multiplication Rule</h1>


				<p> The multiplication rule is based on the number of outcomes per choice multiplied together.


				For two choices: |O1 x O2| = |O1| x |O2|, where O is the number of outcomes for a specific choice.


				We would multiply by more outcomes if there were more choices in a question. </p>


				<p> A general idea about the multiplication rule is that we relate the word ''and'' to our questions. </p>


				<p><strong>Example</strong>: If you want to buy an outfit with a shirt, pants and socks, how many different outfits


				can you choose from 3 shirts, 2 pairs of pants, and 2 pairs of socks? </p>
<center>
<img src= "https://imgur.com/Wt5f2pr.png" height="240" width="350">
</center>


				<p class="tab"> Solution: Outcomes for shirts is 3, Outcomes for pants is 2 and Outcomes for socks is 2.


				So you would use the formula, |O1| x |O2| x |O3| = 3 x 2 x 2 = 12 possible outfits.</p>



				<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: How many possible ways are there to choose one drink from 3 juices and 4 sodas? </p>


<center>
<img src=" https://i.imgur.com/uXGGPsD.png" height="200" width="350">
</center>

				<p class="tab"> Solution: There 7 possible ways since we have a total of 7 choices after adding up the amount of drinks.


				Since we can only choose one out of the given number of drinks, we add the total number of drinks to get the


				possible amount we can choose, even though the word "and" is used. </p>

<hr>


			<h1>Permutations</h1>


				<p>A permuatation refers to an arrangement of a set of members into a an ordered sequence.


				To calculate the number of possible ordered arrangements, we have to use the formula for permutations.


				The formula for calculating permuations is shown as:</p>


<center>


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RjDLrIO.png" width="450" height="180">


</center>


				<p>The variable "n" refers to the number of members in the total set, and the variable


				"r" refers to the number of members from the total set that we want to arrange.</p>


				<p><strong>Example</strong>: A license plate begins with three letters.


				 If the possible letters are A, B, C, D and E, how many different permutations of these letters


				 can be made if no letter is used more than once?</p>


				<p>Solution:</p>


				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2F96YoW.png" alt="The answer is 60." class="tab">

<hr>

			<h1>Combinations</h1>


				<p>A combination refers to an arrangement of a set of members into a an unordered sequence.


				To calculate the number of possible ordered arrangements, we have to use the formula for combinations.</p>


				<p>The formula for calculating combinations is shown as:</p>

<center>


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RlvNOLI.png" width="450" height="180">


</center>

				<p><strong>Example</strong>: Six friends want to play enough games of chess to be sure every one plays everyone else. How many games will they have to play?</p>


				<p>Solution:</p>


				<img src= "https://i.imgur.com/6qQEUg5.png" alt="The answer is 15." class="tab">



				<p>To show what makes combination and permutation different, try the following example:</p>


				<p><strong>Example</strong>: In a lottery, each ticket has 5 one-digit numbers 0-9 on it.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://www.ohiolottery.com/ohiolottery/media/ContentImages/MyLottoRewards/SecondChance/tickets.png" height="250" width="300">
</center>

				<p class="tab">I. You win if your ticket has the digits in any order. What are your chances of winning?</p>


				<p class="tab">II. You would win only if your ticket has the digits in the required order. What are your chances of winning?</p>


				<p>Solution to problem I:</p>


				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rwSQwBZ.png” class="tab">


				<p>Solution to problem II:</p>

				<p class="tab">P(10, 5) = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 = 30240</p>


				<p>When the order does not matter, your chance of winning is 1 in 252, but your chances of winning decrease to 1 in 30240 when order matters.</p>

			<h1>Summary</h1>

				<p>Counting is very important to learn and master. It may seem easy, but things like addition and multiplication for counting can sometimes be tricky.


				Make sure to read the questions carefully and to understand what it is looking for. It may also help to have an image to look at for the questions so


				don't be afraid to make one to help yourself. Once you understand what a counting problem is asking for, you can solve the problem with your newfound


				knowledge of formulas and reasoning that we have shared with you.</p>
