At FDM Group, my role as a Technical Consultant involves partnering with Bank of America's SRE team to develop Flask-based RESTFUL microservices and enhance chatbot functionality for trader support. Our collaborative efforts have led to the creation of scripts that effectively monitor and report application health for executive review.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, with a focus on machine learning, expected to be completed in 2025. My educational journey builds on a solid foundation in mathematics and computer science from Fordham University, where I was also a recipient of the prestigious Loyola Scholarship.
